# bhm-infographic

### Overview
Given the U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, 1968 to 2020 about income, wealth, and poverty, this infographic had the purpose of reporting the results, specifically showcasing the disparities between blacks and other races. Important note that this data and infographic is not a complete, accurate representation of the United States as a whole. It is based on this data alone.

The Python libraries I used in this project are pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. To create the infographic, I used [Piktochart](https://piktochart.com/).

### About the data

- **SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, 1968 to 2020 Annual Social and Economic Supplements (CPS ASEC)**
- The data analyzed represents the income and poverty in the United States as of 2019.
- The data refers to the report of the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplements (CPS ASEC) conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2020. It was published September 15, 2020.
- The wealth and value of asset ownership as of **2017**. There is no recent data that coincides with the wealth and asset ownership for 2019.
- The data refers to the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The purpose of this survey is to assess the effectiveness of federal, state, and local programs.
- All **data collection methods can be found in the original report and original excel files**. Here are some notable ones:
    - "Beginning with the 2003 CPS ASEC, respondents were allowed to choose one ore more races. White alone refers to people who reported White and did not report any other race category."
    - "Because Hispanics may be any race, data in this report for Hispanics overlap with data for racial groups. Hispanic origin was reported by 15.6 percent of White householders who reported only one race, 5.0 percent of Black householders who reported only one race, and 2.5 percent of Asian householders who reported only one race. Data users should exercise caution when interpreting aggregate results for the Hispanic population and for race groups because these populations consist of many distinct groups that differ in socioeconomic characteristics, culture, and recency of immigration. Data were first collected for Hispanics in 1972."
    - Inflation-adjusted estimates may differ slightly from other published data due to rounding.
